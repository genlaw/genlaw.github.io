        <h1>GenLaw ’23: CFP</h1>
        <p>The Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw) is soliciting
        1-2 page extended abstracts related to any topic pertaining to
        recent developments in generative AI/ML and its legal
        implications, with a particular focus on implications for
        intellectual property (IP) and privacy law.</p>
        <p>Possible extended abstract formats include, but are not
        limited to, position papers, preliminary technical results, and
        early-stage law review submissions, which should provide novel
        perspectives and findings at the intersection of law and
        generative AI. Potential topics include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Clarifying open questions within your primary discipline,
        aimed at interdisciplinary communication</li>
        <li>Highlighting industry-related challenges re: development and
        productization of generative models</li>
        <li>Giving legal precision to specific problems presented by
        generative AI, such as analysis of up-coming lawsuits concerning
        Stable Diffusion or CoPilot</li>
        <li>Analyzing data collection and curation anti-patterns (and
        how to improve on them)</li>
        <li>Evaluating models for, or developing ways to minimize, data
        leakages</li>
        <li>Developing tooling for understanding the relationship
        between training data and generative model outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accepted papers will present posters in-person or on Zoom. We
        will also accept other presentation formats, since scholarship
        from some disciplines may not be well-suited to posters. For
        alternative options, we will provide sample templates.
        Additionally, some submissions will be accepted for a 3-minute
        spotlight.</p>
        <p>Please submit to OpenReview by <strong>5 June 2023,
        AoE</strong> [not yet open].</p>
        <p>Please anonymize your submission and respect a 2 pages
        maximum using the <a
        href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/StyleAuthorInstructions">ICML
        Template</a> (excluding references, up to 2 additional
        pages).</p>
