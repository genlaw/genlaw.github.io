<!-- Please see our (*draft*) [CFP](https://genlaw.github.io/cfp.html) and submit an extended abstract by **5 June 2023, AoE**. -->
<p>The 1st Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw) is soliciting 1-2 page extended abstracts related to any topic pertaining to recent developments in generative AI/ML and their legal implications, with a particular focus on implications for intellectual property (IP) and privacy law. Submissions should employ methods from AI/ML, law, or both.</p>
<p>Possible extended abstract formats include, but are not limited to, preliminary technical results, early-stage law review submissions, and position papers,which should provide novel perspectives and findings at the intersection of generative AI and law. Potential topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Communicating discoveries or questions within your primary discipline that other disciplines may want to be aware of</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: How can we create quantitative tools to adequately measure “substantial similarity” (a concept in copyright law) in diffusion model outputs?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Highlighting industry-related challenges re: development and productization of generative models</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Methods for identifying and excising copyright violations at run-time</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Giving legal precision to specific problems presented by generative AI</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: An analysis of the technical and legal considerations in upcoming lawsuits concerning Stable Diffusion or CoPilot</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Analyzing data collection and curation anti-patterns (and how to improve on them)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Documenting current data collection practices, methods for evaluating collected data, datasheets for datasets</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Evaluating models for, or developing ways to minimize, data leakages</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Quantitative procedures for efficiently and comprehensively identifying the use or removal of PII (personal identifiable information) data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Developing tooling for understanding the relationship between training data and generative model outputs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: HCI and UI concerns around conveying issues around LLM memorization and attribution</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted papers will present posters in-person or on Zoom. We will also accept other presentation formats, since scholarship from some disciplines may not be well-suited to posters. For alternative options, we will provide sample templates. Additionally, some submissions will be accepted for a 3-minute spotlight. This workshop is non-archival to allow for future submission to other venues (any/all archival and non-archival workshops, journals, conferences, etc.). We will host all accepted papers on the website, unless requested not to do so by the authors.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/GenLaw2023/Submission/Index">submit to CMT</a>. We will review submissions in a rolling fashion, in order to enable as much time as possible for the visa application process for authors who would need a visa to attend GenLaw ’23 in person. <strong>The submission window will begin 4 May 2023, AoE and end on 29 May 2023, AoE</strong>, and the form will contain a checkbox to indicate if there is at least one author that plans to attend GenLaw ’23 and would need a visa to do so. If this category is applicable, please submit as early as possible to facilitate speedy review. We will prioritize reviewing submissions in this category, and will provide rolling acceptance/rejection decisions (up until 19 June 2023).</p>
<p>Please anonymize your submission and respect a 2-page maximum using the <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/StyleAuthorInstructions">ICML Template</a>. We allow up to 2 <em>additional</em> pages for references. We will be using a double-blind review process.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="#reviewer-guidelines">reviewer guidelines</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera-ready and attendance instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Camera Ready Deadline</strong>: July 7th, AoE on <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/GenLaw2023/Submission/Index">CMT</a></p>
<p><strong>ICML Workshops Registration</strong>: All attendees must register for ICML workshops. Please register on this <a href="https://icml.cc/Register2">page</a>, where there are both in-person and virtual options at checkout.</p>
<p>All papers should use this LaTeX <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/genlaw-workshop-icml-2023/fgqdwhyjcsfy">template</a> on Overleaf. If you are new to LaTeX or Overleaf and run into issues using this template to prepare your final paper, please reach out to <a class="email" href="mailto:genlaw.org@gmail.com">genlaw.org@gmail.com</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>Please incorporate the feedback from reviewers (and, if provided, meta-reviewers) in final paper versions. <strong>We will allow one additional page of main text (3 pages total)</strong> to accommodate these changes and author names. If you would like to include a 4th page of main text, please email the organizers to ask. We also allow for unlimited pages for citations and (optionally) an appendix. Please consult the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/genlaw-workshop-icml-2023/fgqdwhyjcsfy">template</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>Please submit your camera-ready paper on CMT by July 7, AoE as a zip file containing all related submission files (images, LaTeX files), including a PDF.</p>
<h3 id="online-paper-hosting">Online paper hosting</h3>
<p>We are going to host the PDFs on the workshop website, and will also include a web-friendly HTML version (We will convert the raw LaTeX files to html). If authors do not wish for their paper to be included on the website, please email <a class="email" href="mailto:genlaw.org@gmail.com">genlaw.org@gmail.com</a> with: “Please do not host paper {Paper #} on the GenLaw website.”</p>
<h3 id="poster-session">Poster session</h3>
<p>All accepted papers will be required to present at the workshop poster session. Since this is an interdisciplinary workshop, we are flexible on the format for poster presentation.</p>
<p>The main ICML conference offers a printing service at the venue for workshop posters. Unfortunately, the poster deadline for printing through the conference venue is July 23, 2023. Please see the ICML poster printing <a href="https://icml.cc/posterprinting/">page</a> for more information. There will be other vendors in Honolulu who can print posters. Alternatively, posters could be printed in advance before you travel and brought to ICML.</p>
<h2 id="reviewer-guidelines">Reviewer Guidelines</h2>
<p>Papers will be reviewed by a panel of 3 interdisciplinary reviewers.</p>
<p>Reviews will consist of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>1-2 sentence summary of the paper (this is not a critical review)</li>
<li>A multiple choice question concerning alignment of the submission with the CFP</li>
<li>2-3 sentence critical review that addresses overall clarity, soundness/rigor, originality/novelty, and adequate treatment of related work. We provide more details on these considerations below:
<ol type="a">
<li>An abstract that submits a novel “big idea” nevertheless needs to have a sufficient level of detail to be able to evaluate its feasibility and relationship to prior work. The abstract should be well motivated with connections to prior work.</li>
<li>We will also accept abstracts that build on prior work in smaller ways, as long as they are well-written and sound. Bringing significant clarity to existing discussions can also be a useful contribution in its own right.</li>
<li>We deliberately limited the number of pages of references to emphasize quality of engagement with existing work, rather than quantity, especially given that these are short papers.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A recommendation (accept, unsure, reject). This recommendation should be grounded in the critical review.</li>
<li>If the recommendation is “accept”: 1 sentence on your favorite strength(s) about the submission. We will use this to highlight high-quality submissions on the website. Feel free to directly copy or repurpose language from the critical review.
<ol type="a">
<li>We will have some recognition (more specific than “best”) for high-quality submissions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A confidence score regarding the recommendation.</li>
<li>A checkbox to recommend particularly outstanding papers for a spotlight talk during the workshop.</li>
<li>A checkbox to indicate red flags/ ethical concerns (with an open text box).</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, the following field will not be visible to other reviewers or to authors.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>An additional box for confidential comments to the organizers.</li>
</ol>
