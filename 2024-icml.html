            <p>We are very excited to announce the second Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw ’24)! Please join us in Vienna, Austria at <a href="https://icml.cc/">ICML ’24</a>, where we’ll be bringing together experts in privacy, ML, policy, and law to discuss the intellectual property (IP) and privacy challenges that generative AI raises with a special focus on UK and EU issues.</p>
            <p>Read our <a href="https://genlaw.org/2023-report.html">report</a> from last year, an explainer on <a href="https://genlaw.org/explainers/training-data.html">training dataset curation</a>, and a piece on the <a href="https://genlaw.org/explainers/talkin.html">copyright issues</a> generative AI raises.</p>

            <p>Progress in generative AI depends not only on better model architectures, but on terabytes of scraped Flickr images, Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow answers, and websites. But generative models ingest vast quantities of intellectual property (IP), which they can memorize and regurgitate verbatim. Several recently-filed lawsuits relate such memorization to copyright infringement. These lawsuits will lead to policies and legal rulings that define our ability, as ML researchers and practitioners, to acquire training data, and our responsibilities towards data owners and curators.</p>
            <p>AI researchers will increasingly operate in a legal environment that is keenly interested in their work — an environment that may require future research into model architectures that conform to legal requirements. Understanding the law and contributing to its development will enable us to create safer, better, and practically useful models. <!-- Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between ML researchers and practitioners, data curators, HCI researchers, and legal experts[@cooper2022accountabiliy]. --></p>
            <h3 id="our-workshop">Our Workshop</h3>
            <p>We’re excited to share a series of tutorials from <a href="index.html#speakers">renowned experts</a> in both ML and law and panel discussions, where researchers in both disciplines can engage in semi-moderated conversation.</p>
            <p>Our workshop will begin to build a comprehensive and precise synthesis of the legal issues at play. Beyond IP, the workshop will also address privacy and liability for dangerous, discriminatory, or misleading and manipulative outputs. It will take place on 27 July 2024.</p>

            Cooper studies how to make more reliable conclusions when using ML methods in practice. This work has thus-far focused on empirically motivated, theoretically grounded problems in Bayesian inference, model selection, and deep learning. Cooper has published numerous papers at top ML conferences, interdisciplinary computing venues, and tech law journals. Much of this work has been recognized with spotlight and contributed talk awards. Cooper has also been recognized as a Rising Star in EECS (MIT, 2021).

            Cooper studies how to make more reliable conclusions when using ML methods in practice. This work has thus-far focused on empirically motivated, theoretically grounded problems in Bayesian inference, model selection, and deep learning. Cooper has published numerous papers at top ML conferences, interdisciplinary computing venues, and tech law journals. Much of this work has been recognized with spotlight and contributed talk awards. Cooper has also been recognized as a Rising Star in EECS (MIT, 2021).

            James Grimmelmann is the Tessler Family Professor of Digital and Information Law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School. He studies how laws regulating software affect freedom, wealth, and power. He helps lawyers and technologists understand each other, applying ideas from computer science to problems in law and vice versa. He is the author of the casebook Internet Law: Cases and Problems and of over fifty scholarly articles and essays on digital copyright, content moderation, search engine regulation, online governance, privacy on social networks, and other topics in computer and Internet law. He organized the D is for Digitize conference in 2009 on the copyright litigation over the Google Book Search project, the In re Books conference in 2012 on the legal and cultural future of books in the digital age, and the Speed conference in 2018 on the implications of radical technology-induced acceleration for law, society, and policy.
