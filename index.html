</header>
<p>Progress in generative AI depends not only on better model architectures, but on terabytes of scraped Flickr images, Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow answers, and websites. That is, generative models ingest vast quantities of intellectual property (IP), which they can memorize and regurgitate verbatim <span class="citation" data-cites="extracting quantifying diffusion">[@extracting; @quantifying; @diffusion]</span>. Several recently-filed lawsuits relate such memorization to copyright infringement <span class="citation" data-cites="midjourney feldman copilot stable-diffusion">[@midjourney; @feldman; @copilot; @stable-diffusion]</span>. These lawsuits will lead to policies and legal rulings that define our ability, as ML researchers and practitioners, to acquire training data, and our responsibilities towards data owners and curators. AI researchers will increasingly operate in a legal environment that is keenly interested in their work — an environment that may require future research into model architectures that conform to legal requirements. As such, just as it is vital to inform courts and policymakers of the realities of AI work, ICML attendees must be well informed about law.</p>
<p>Our workshop will begin to build a comprehensive and precise synthesis of the legal issues at play. Beyond IP, the workshop will also address privacy and liability for dangerous, discriminatory, or misleading and manipulative outputs. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between ML researchers and practitioners, data curators, HCI researchers, and legal experts <span class="citation" data-cites="cooper2022accountabiliy">[@cooper2022accountabiliy]</span>. We will mix tutorial-style presentations from renowned experts in both ML and law with panel discussions where researchers in both disciplines can engage in semi-moderated conversation. We will solicit extended abstracts to encourage a diverse range of scholars to attend and present their work as posters and lightning talks. Based on enthusiasm and interest in soliciting speakers and PC members, as well as the recent explosion of general public interest in generative AI, we expect around 100 attendees in person, and 50 virtually.</p>

<!-- Katherine's work has provided essential empirical evidence and measurement for grounding discussions around concerns that language models, like CoPilot, are infringing copyright, and about how language models can respect an individuals' right to privacy and control of their data. Additionally, she has proposed methods of reducing memorization. Her work has received recognition at ACL and USENIX.  -->
<!-- Cooper studies how to align the use of AI/ML with broader public values, and has published numerous papers at top ML conferences, interdisciplinary computing venues, and tech law review journals. Much of this work has been recognized with spotlight and contributed talk awards. Cooper has also been recognized as a Rising Star in EECS (MIT, 2021). Since 2020, Cooper has been the Ph.D. student organizer for the MacArthur-funded Artificial Intelligence Policy and Practice initiative at Cornell, an interdisciplinary working group that studies the technical, social, and legal implications of AI technology.\ -->

Fatemeh's research aims at understanding learning and memorization
patterns in large language models, probing these models for safety
issues (such as bias), and providing tools to limit their leakage of
private information. She is a recipient of the National Center for Women
& IT (NCWIT) Collegiate award in 2020 for her work on privacy-preserving
inference, a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2021,
and a recipient of the 2022 Rising Star in Adversarial ML award. She was
a co-chair of the NAACL 2022 conference and has been a co-organizer for
numerous successful workshops, including Distributed and Private ML
(DPML) at ICLR 2021, Federated Learning for NLP (FL4NLP) at ACL 2022,
Private NLP at NAACL 2022 and Widening NLP at EMNLP 2021 and 2022.\
