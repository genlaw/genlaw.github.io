        <h1>Generative AI + Law (GenLaw) ’23</h1>
        <p>We are very excited to announce the inaugural Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw ’23)! Please join us in Honolulu, Hawai’i at <a href="https://icml.cc/">ICML ’23</a>, where we’ll be bringing together experts in privacy, ML, policy, and law to discuss the intellectual property (IP) and privacy challenges that generative AI raises.</p>

        <h3 id="about-genlaw">About GenLaw</h3>
        <p>Progress in generative AI depends not only on better model architectures, but on terabytes of scraped Flickr images, Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow answers, and websites. But generative models ingest vast quantities of intellectual property (IP), which they can memorize and regurgitate verbatim. Several recently-filed lawsuits relate such memorization to copyright infringement. These lawsuits will lead to policies and legal rulings that define our ability, as ML researchers and practitioners, to acquire training data, and our responsibilities towards data owners and curators.</p>
        <p>AI researchers will increasingly operate in a legal environment that is keenly interested in their work — an environment that may require future research into model architectures that conform to legal requirements. Understanding the law and contributing to its development will enable us to create safer, better, and practically useful models. <!-- Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between ML researchers and practitioners, data curators, HCI researchers, and legal experts[@cooper2022accountabiliy]. --></p>
        <h3 id="our-workshop">Our Workshop</h3>
        <p>We’re excited to share a series of tutorials from <a href="schedule.html">renowned experts</a> (to be announced soon!) in both ML and law and panel discussions, where researchers in both disciplines can engage in semi-moderated conversation.</p>
        <p>Our workshop will begin to build a comprehensive and precise synthesis of the legal issues at play. Beyond IP, the workshop will also address privacy and liability for dangerous, discriminatory, or misleading and manipulative outputs.</p>
        <h2 id="cfp">CFP</h2>
        <!-- Please see our (*draft*) [CFP](https://genlaw.github.io/cfp.html) and submit an extended abstract by **5 June 2023, AoE**. -->
        <p>The 1st Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw) is soliciting 1-2 page extended abstracts related to any topic pertaining to recent developments in generative AI/ML and its legal implications, with a particular focus on implications for intellectual property (IP) and privacy law.</p>
        <p>Possible extended abstract formats include, but are not limited to, position papers, preliminary technical results, and early-stage law review submissions, which should provide novel perspectives and findings at the intersection of law and generative AI. Potential topics include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Clarifying open questions within your primary discipline, aimed at interdisciplinary communication</li>
        <li>Highlighting industry-related challenges re: development and productization of generative models</li>
        <li>Giving legal precision to specific problems presented by generative AI, such as analysis of upcoming lawsuits concerning Stable Diffusion or CoPilot</li>
        <li>Analyzing data collection and curation anti-patterns (and how to improve on them)</li>
        <li>Evaluating models for, or developing ways to minimize, data leakages</li>
        <li>Developing tooling for understanding the relationship between training data and generative model outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accepted papers will present posters in-person or on Zoom. We will also accept other presentation formats, since scholarship from some disciplines may not be well-suited to posters. For alternative options, we will provide sample templates. Additionally, some submissions will be accepted for a 3-minute spotlight. This workshop is <strong>non-archival</strong> to allow for future submission to other venues (any/all archival and non-archival workshops, journals, conferences, etc.). We will host all accepted papers on the website, unless requested not to do so by the authors.</p>
        <p>Please submit to OpenReview by <strong>4 May 2023, AoE</strong> [not yet open]. The review form will contain a checkbox to indicate if there is at least one author that plans to attend GenLaw ’23 and would need a visa to do so. We will prioritize reviewing submissions in this category, and will provide rolling acceptance/rejection decisions (up until 19 June 2023) in order to enable as much time as possible for the visa application process.</p>
        <p>Please anonymize your submission and respect a 2-page maximum using the <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/StyleAuthorInstructions">ICML Template</a> (excluding references, for which we allow up to 2 additional pages).</p>

        Katherine’s work has provided essential empirical evidence and measurement for grounding discussions around concerns that language models, like CoPilot, are infringing copyright, and about how language models can respect an individuals’ right to privacy and control of their data. Additionally, she has proposed methods of reducing memorization. Her work has received recognition at ACL and USENIX.

        Cooper studies how to make more reliable conclusions when using ML methods in practice. This work has thus-far focused on empirically motivated, theoretically grounded problems in Bayesian inference, model selection, and deep learning. Cooper has published numerous papers at top ML conferences, interdisciplinary computing venues, and tech law journals. Much of this work has been recognized with spotlight and contributed talk awards. Cooper has also been recognized as a Rising Star in EECS (MIT, 2021).

        James Grimmelmann is the Tessler Family Professor of Digital and Information Law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School. He studies how laws regulating software affect freedom, wealth, and power. He helps lawyers and technologists understand each other, applying ideas from computer science to problems in law and vice versa. He is the author of the casebook Internet Law: Cases and Problems and of over fifty scholarly articles and essays on digital copyright, content moderation, search engine regulation, online governance, privacy on social networks, and other topics in computer and Internet law. He organized the D is for Digitize conference in 2009 on the copyright litigation over the Google Book Search project, the In re Books conference in 2012 on the legal and cultural future of books in the digital age, and the Speed conference in 2018 on the implications of radical technology-induced acceleration for law, society, and policy.

        David Mimno builds models and methodologies that empower researchers outside NLP to use language technology. He was general chair of the 2022 Text As Data conference at Cornell Tech and organized a workshop on topic models at NeurIPS. His work spans from education to the development of advanced new language technology driven by the needs of non-expert users. He is chief developer of the popular Mallet toolkit and is currently co-PI on the NEH-sponsored BERT for Humanists project. His work has been supported by the Sloan foundation and NSF
