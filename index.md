We are very excited to announce the inaugural Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw '23)! Please join us in Honolulu, Hawai'i at [ICML '23](https://icml.cc/), where we'll be bringing together experts in privacy, ML, policy, and law to discuss the intellectual property (IP) and privacy challenges that generative AI raises.

### About GenLaw

Progress in generative AI depends not only on better model architectures, but on terabytes of scraped Flickr images, Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow answers, and websites. 
But, generative models ingest vast quantities of intellectual property (IP), which they can memorize and regurgitate verbatim[@extracting; @quantifying; @diffusion]. Several recently-filed lawsuits relate such memorization to copyright infringement[@midjourney; @feldman; @copilot; @stable-diffusion]. 
These lawsuits will lead to policies and legal rulings that define our ability, as ML researchers and practitioners, to acquire training data, and our responsibilities towards data owners and curators. 

AI researchers will increasingly operate in a legal environment that is keenly interested in their work --- an environment that may require future research into model architectures that conform to legal requirements. 
As such, just as it is vital to inform courts and policymakers of the realities of AI work, ICML attendees must be well informed about law.
<!-- Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between ML researchers and practitioners, data curators, HCI researchers, and legal experts[@cooper2022accountabiliy]. -->


### Our Workshop

We're excited to share a series of tutorials from [renowned experts](schedule.html) (to be announced soon!) in both ML and law and panel discussions, where researchers in both disciplines can engage in semi-moderated conversation. 

Our workshop will begin to build a comprehensive and precise synthesis of the legal issues at play. Beyond IP, the workshop will also address privacy and liability for dangerous, discriminatory, or misleading and manipulative outputs. 

### CFP

Please see our (*draft*) [CFP](https://genlaw.github.io/cfp.html) and submit an extended abstract by **5 June 2023, AoE**.

        Katherine's work has provided essential empirical evidence and measurement for grounding discussions around
        concerns that language models, like CoPilot, are infringing copyright, and about how language models can respect
        an individuals' right to privacy and control of their data. Additionally, she has proposed methods of reducing
        memorization. Her work has received recognition at ACL and USENIX.

        Cooper studies how to make more reliable conclusions when using ML methods in practice. This work has thus-far focused on empirically motivated, theoretically grounded problems in Bayesian inference, model selection, and deep learning. Cooper has published numerous papers at top ML conferences, interdisciplinary computing venues, and tech law journals. Much of this work has been recognized with spotlight and contributed talk awards. Cooper has also been recognized as a Rising Star in EECS (MIT, 2021).

        Fatemeh's research aims at understanding learning and memorization
        patterns in large language models, probing these models for safety
        issues (such as bias), and providing tools to limit their leakage of
        private information. She is a recipient of the National Center for Women
        & IT (NCWIT) Collegiate award in 2020 for her work on privacy-preserving
        inference, a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2021,
        and a recipient of the 2022 Rising Star in Adversarial ML award. She was
        a co-chair of the NAACL 2022 conference and has been a co-organizer for
        numerous successful workshops, including Distributed and Private ML
        (DPML) at ICLR 2021, Federated Learning for NLP (FL4NLP) at ACL 2022,
        Private NLP at NAACL 2022 and Widening NLP at EMNLP 2021 and 2022

        outside NLP to use language technology. He was general chair of the 2022
        Text As Data conference at Cornell Tech and organized a workshop on
        topic models at NeurIPS. His work spans from education to the
