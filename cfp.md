The 1st Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw) is soliciting 1-2 page extended abstracts related to any topic pertaining to recent developments in generative AI/ML and its legal implications, with a particular focus on implications for intellectual property (IP) and privacy law.

Possible extended abstract formats include, but are not limited to, position papers, preliminary technical results, and early-stage law review submissions, which should provide novel perspectives and findings at the intersection of law and generative AI. Potential topics include:

* Clarifying open questions within your primary discipline, aimed at interdisciplinary communication
* Highlighting industry-related challenges re: development and productization of generative models
* Giving legal precision to specific problems presented by generative AI, such as analysis of upcoming lawsuits concerning Stable Diffusion or CoPilot 
* Analyzing data collection and curation anti-patterns (and how to improve on them)
* Evaluating models for, or developing ways to minimize, data leakages
* Developing tooling for understanding the relationship between training data and generative model outputs.

Accepted papers will present posters in-person or on Zoom. We will also accept other presentation formats, since scholarship from some disciplines may not be well-suited to posters. For alternative options, we will provide sample templates. Additionally, some submissions will be accepted for a 3-minute spotlight.

Please submit to OpenReview by **5 June 2023, AoE** [not yet open].

Please anonymize your submission and respect a 2-page maximum using the [ICML Template](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/StyleAuthorInstructions) (excluding references, for which we allow up to 2 additional pages).
